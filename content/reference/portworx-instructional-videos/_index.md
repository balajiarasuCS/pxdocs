## Data Locality with Stork (Storage Orchestrator for Kubernetes)

Stork is the Portworx’s storage scheduler for Kubernetes that helps achieve even tighter integration of Portworx with Kubernetes. It allows users to co-locate pods with their data, provides seamless migration of pods in case of storage errors and makes it easier to create and restore snapshots of Portworx volumes. In this video, we’ll explore how stork enables colocation of pods and their data.
