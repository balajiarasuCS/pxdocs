This guide explains how the Portworx Dynamic Disk Provisioning feature works within Kubernetes on VMware and the requirements for it.

{{<info>}}Installation steps below are only supported if you are running with Kubernetes.{{</info>}}

## Availability across failure domains

Since Portworx is a storage overlay that automatically replicates your data, we recommend using multiple availability zones when creating your VMware vSphere based cluster. Portworx automatically detects regions and zones that are populated using known Kubernetes node labels. You can also label nodes with custom labels to inform Portworx about region, zones and racks. Refer to the [Cluster Topology awareness](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/operate-and-maintain-on-kubernetes/cluster-topology/) page for more details.

## Installation

{{<info>}}Run these steps from a machine which has kubectl access to your cluster.{{</info>}}
