This document guides you through editing the Portworx manifest YAML file as shown in
the Enabling authorization section [example](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/operate-and-maintain-on-kubernetes/authorization/enable/#example).

This procedure instructs Kubernetes to create and provide Portworx with
environment variables whose values are retrieved securely from the Secret object
created in the Generate shared secrets section.

## Prerequisites

* If you do not already have a manifest, visit [PX-Central](https://central.portworx.com)
to generate and download a deployment YAML for your configuration.
* You must have a value for the [token issuer](/concepts/authorization/install/#configuration). The issuer is a string value which must identify the token generator. This value will be used by Portworx to identify the token generator. In the examples below the issuer is set to `portworx.com`, but you are encouraged to change it.

Perform the following steps to enable security in Portworx by editing the Portworx YAML manifest and making the following additions:

<!-- the way this was written has me questioning whether I'm supposed to have done something already. Do users 'edit the Portworx YAML manifest' as part of these steps, or somewhere before them? -->

1. Add issuer to the `portworx/oci-monitor` args:

    ```
       ... "-jwt_issuer", "portworx.com"]
    ```

2. Add references to the shared keys as environment variables to
`portworx/oci-monitor`:

    ```text
        - name: "PORTWORX_AUTH_JWT_SHAREDSECRET"
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: pxkeys
              key: shared-secret
        - name: "PORTWORX_AUTH_SYSTEM_KEY"
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: pxkeys
              key: system-secret
        - name: "PORTWORX_AUTH_STORK_KEY"
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: pxkeys
              key: stork-secret
    ```

3. Add references to the shared key to `openstorage/stork`:

    ```text
        - name: "PX_SHARED_SECRET"
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: pxkeys
              key: stork-secret
    ```

4. You can now apply the manifest and wait until Portworx is ready.

<!-- are there any instructions for this? -->

Once you've enabled security in Portworx, continue to the **Generate tokens** section.
