description: Learn to take a cloud snapshot of a volume from a Kubernetes persistent volume claim (PVC) and use that snapshot as the volume for a new pod. Try today!
---

This document will show you how to create cloud snapshots of Portworx volumes and how you can clone those snapshots to use them in pods.

{{<info>}}
**NOTE:** You cannot use an older version of Portworx to restore a cloud snapshot created with a newer one. For example, if you're running Portworx 2.1, you can't restore a cloud snapshot created with Portworx 2.2.

## Back up a volume and restore it to the same Portworx cluster

This section shows how you can back up a volume and restore it to the same Portworx cluster.

### Prerequisites

* This requires that you already have [Stork](/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/storage-operations/stork) installed and running on your
Kubernetes cluster. If you fetched the Portworx specs from the Portworx spec generator in [PX-Central](https://central.portworx.com) and used the default options, Stork is already installed.
* Cloud snapshots using below method is supported in Portworx version 1.4 and above.
* Cloud snapshots (for aggregated volumes) using below method is supported in Portworx version 2.0 and above.

## Create cloud snapshots

With cloud snapshots, you can either snapshot individual PVCs one by one or snapshot a group of PVCs.

## Restore cloud snapshots

Once you've created a cloud snapshot, you can restore it to a new PVC or the original PVC.
